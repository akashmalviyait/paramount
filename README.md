# React-navigation-drawer-boilerplate
Boilerplate code for an Expo based react native application using a drawer menu. Includes a short demonstration of nested navigation and authentication flow. Has no dependencies except for React navigation. This was the easiest way I could figure out drawer navigation and I hope it helps others too.

This repo is currently using Expo version 37.0.3 and React Native SDK 37.0.1.

Modify it to meet your needs.
